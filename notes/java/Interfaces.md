### **Interfaces in Java**
In Java, an **interface** is a special type of class that contains only method declarations (signatures) but no implementations (code inside the methods). It acts as a contract or blueprint that other classes can follow, indicating that, "If you want to be of this type, you must have these methods, and they should behave in a certain way."

#### **Key Points about Interfaces:**
1. **No Method Implementation**: 
   - Interfaces only have method names (signatures) but do not provide the code inside them. Any class that **implements** an interface must provide the actual code for each method declared in the interface.
  
2. **No Instance Variables**: 
   - Interfaces can only have constants (variables that are `final` and `static`). They cannot have regular instance variables like a typical class.

3. **Multiple Implementation**: 
   - A major benefit of interfaces is that a class in Java can implement multiple interfaces. This is useful because Java classes can only inherit from one parent class (single inheritance). Thus, interfaces offer a way to add multiple “types” to a class.

#### **Important Note**:
- It’s entirely possible to have the same method in two interfaces that require you to define it. It doesn’t matter where it comes from as long as you define it.

### **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**
When you don’t want to implement all the methods of an interface in a class, you can declare that class as **abstract**. Here’s why:

#### **Why Use an Abstract Class with an Interface?**
When a class implements an interface, it’s expected to provide implementations for all of the interface’s methods. However, if you don’t want to provide all the implementations right away, you can declare the class as `abstract`. This makes it clear that the class isn’t complete on its own, and subclasses will need to finish the job by implementing the remaining methods.

### **Generic Interfaces**
In Java, **generic interfaces** allow you to define an interface with type parameters, enabling you to create interfaces that work with different data types without rewriting code. This makes the code more flexible and reusable.

**Example**: Let’s say you want to create a `Container` interface that can store any type of data. You can use generics to make this interface flexible.

```java
interface Container<T> {
    void add(T item);
    T get();
}
```

#### **Implementing a Generic Interface**:
```java
class IntegerContainer implements Container<Integer> {
    private Integer item;

    public void add(Integer item) {
        this.item = item;
    }

    public Integer get() {
        return item;
    }
}
```

# when wanting to define a method within an Interface
### **Static Methods in Interfaces**: cant be overriden outside the interface
- **Purpose**: Static methods in an interface belong to the interface itself, not to any instance of a class that implements it. They’re used when you want to define a utility or helper method related to the interface but don’t want it to be inherited by implementing classes.
  
- **Usage**: To call a static method in an interface, you use the interface name, not an instance.

**Example**: Static methods are commonly used for utility functions related to the interface that don’t need access to an instance.

```java
interface Calculator {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = Calculator.add(5, 3); // Called directly on the interface
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); // Output: Sum: 8
    }
}
```

---

### **Default Methods in Interfaces**: can be overriden outside the interface
- **Purpose**: Default methods were introduced in Java 8 to provide a way for interfaces to have concrete methods without breaking existing code. If an interface defines a default method, any implementing class inherits it and can use it as is or override it.
  
- **Usage**: Default methods allow you to add new functionality to an interface while maintaining backward compatibility with older implementations.

**Example**: Default methods are useful for providing a "default" implementation that can be overridden by implementing classes if they need different behavior.

```java
interface Calculator {
    default int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }
}

class AdvancedCalculator implements Calculator {
    // Can override subtract() if needed or use the default
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new AdvancedCalculator();
        int result = calc.subtract(10, 4); // Uses default method
        System.out.println("Result: " + result); // Output: Result: 6
    }
}
```

---

### **When to Use Each**
- Use **static methods** when you need a utility function that’s directly related to the interface but not tied to an instance.
  
- Use **default methods** when you want to provide a common implementation that can be inherited and optionally overridden by implementing classes.
